# React Redux Weather App

## Summary
An application using React and Redux to display a five-day forecast for any user-input US city.  I used axios to fetch data from the OpenWeather API, the redux-promise library to resolve the asynchronous data fetched from OpenWeather, Sparklines to generate the charts, and Google Maps for additional effect.

To get started, just clone the app and run the following commands:
```
  npm install
  npm start
```
Open your browser and open up `localhost:8080` to view it!
